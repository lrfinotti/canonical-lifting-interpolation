# Canonical Lifting Comparison
This repo contains the code used in my dissertation to compare the two algorithms for computing canonical liftings of elliptic curves.

# Sage Version

The command line program is `sage/profile.sage`. The code in `sage/witt` is hopefully going to be included in Sage in a future version, but I'm including it here for the mean time.

# Magma Version

My goal is to rewrite this code in [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) eventually.
